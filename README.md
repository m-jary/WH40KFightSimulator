# WH40KFightSimulator

WIP

A simple simulator for Warhammer 40,000. The program can compare statistics of two units, print how much damage will be dealt and if the defender's unit is still alive.
In the future I'd like to add more features and modifiers to the program to allow for more advanced simulations.
